<br />
<p>The P-3C Orion will be carrying various instruments designed for collecting data.  One of these instruments includes the Atlas sensor. This sensor has a three beam laser that will be used on ICESat-II and has improved elevation estimates. Other instruments that will be used consist of:  DACOM, AVOCET, ACAM2, DLH, P-3C Strobe Data System, Snow Radar, and MCo RDS.</p>
<br />
<p>Spectrometers identify chemicals by sampling them through an inlet and running various tests against them to determine their composition, whereas remote sensing uses a variety of techniques to create a topographical mapping of a given area.</p>
<br />
<p>Langley Aerosol Research Group Experiment (LARGE) is a clister of instrumentation that provides precise measurements of aerosol character, aerosol levels, and traces.</p>
<br />
<p>And as all airborne laboratories, the P-3C Orion has a stock data system for basic navigational and geological data such as altitude and location.</p>
<br />
<p>The Diode Laser Hygrometer (DLH) is a tunable diode laser spectrometer which identifies water vapor.</p>
<br />
<p>Differential Absorption CO Measurement (DACOM) is a three channel tunable diode laser spectrometer that identifies carbon monoxide, methane, and dinitrogen monoxide.</p>
<br />
<p>Atmospheric Vertical Observations of CO2 in the Earth's Troposphere (AVOCET) is a CO2 identifier and tracer which records carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<br />
<p>Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) is a sensor that consists of two spectrographs and a video camera that records air quality and ocean color.</p>
<br />
<p>On the ground, the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) will also provide data about aerosol character and composition.</p>
<br />
<p>The airborne laboratory allows these sensors to work in synchrony and transport data via the INMARSAT and IRIDIUM satellite constellations which provide data uplink/downlink, internet, flight tracking, and instant messaging with the ground amongst other functions.</p>
