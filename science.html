<p>NASA's main goal is to drive advances in science, technology, and exploration to enhance knowledge, education, economic vitality, and stewardship of the Earth.</p>
<br />
<p>The main goal of the DISCIce-AQ is:</p>
<blockquote> To characterize air quality and ice mass and thickness in polar regions to collect critical data of correlation between pollution concentration and ice mass and thickness.</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the goal of our mission goes hand-in-hand with what NASA is trying to accomplish.</p>
<br />
<p>The DISCIce-AQ mission objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantifying the differences pollutants in air columns above polar regions</li>
<li>Characterizing annual changes in thickness of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets</li>
<li>Collecting critical data used to predict the response of
earthâ€™s polar ice to climate change</li>
</ul>
